I know that some of my friends work because they wanted the money for student fees and books etc. At first, I had the same plan as they did but as time went on I found that I was losing interest in studying and always tired. So instead of just working to study, I decided to save some of the money for travel, take a short break and then return to my studies feeling refreshed and like I had done something for myself. I know that studying is worthwhile and I will finish my degree but I have also been studying for most of my life and felt like I needed a break. It has been great so far and I don't regret my decision one bit. My old man (father) wasn't too impressed with the idea though and tried to talk me out of it with these long boring lectures. Finally, I just decided to go ahead and do it and I am glad I did. So, I think that it is important for college students to work part-time because it gives them the freedom to either do as I did or just the cash to relax a bit more in style after so many years of study, study, study.</td>\n",

       "803  ﻿It was important for me because it allowed me to take time off and travel to Japan. I know that some of my friends work because they wanted the money for student fees and books etc. At first, I had the same plan as they did but as time went on I found that I was losing interest in studying and always tired. So instead of just working to study, I decided to save some of the money for travel, take a short break and then return to my studies feeling refreshed and like I had done something for myself. I know that studying is worthwhile and I will finish my degree but I have also been studying for most of my life and felt like I needed a break. It has been great so far and I don't regret my decision one bit. My old man (father) wasn't too impressed with the idea though and tried to talk me out of it with these long boring lectures. Finally, I just decided to go ahead and do it and I am glad I did. So, I think that it is important for college students to work part-time because it gives them the freedom to either do as I did or just the cash to relax a bit more in style after so many years of study, study, study.   \n",

    "**Although the distributions are still pretty normal, essay sentence counts shows bigger difference among countries compared to essay vocabulary. E.g. native speakers' essays tend to contain less sentences, and it makes sense. Native speakers are able to use English more efficiently compare to English learners. Take learners from Japan and Korea for example, the means of sentence count are higher then native speaker group, indicating more sentences for the same given essay topic.**\n",

    "*One interesting finding is that learners from **Thailand** tend to write less sentences, too! This observation led to further investigation demonstrated later in this notebook*"
